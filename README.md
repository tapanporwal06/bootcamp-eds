## Description

This project is designed as a learning resource for students to grasp the basics of Next.js. It provides a simple Next.js starter project and a helpful tool: a README generator that simplifies the process of creating documentation for their own projects. The project incorporates Gemini to enhance its functionality.

## Motive

The primary motive behind this project is to empower students with a practical understanding of Next.js. By working through the starter project and utilizing the README generator, students will gain hands-on experience and confidence in building web applications with Next.js. The integration of Gemini aims to expose students to the possibilities of incorporating AI into their projects.

## Features and Working

This project offers the following key features:

*   **Simple Next.js Starter:** A basic Next.js project structure that serves as a foundation for learning and experimentation. It includes essential configurations and components to get students started quickly.
*   **README Generator:** A tool that automates the creation of README files for projects. Users can input project details, and the generator will produce a well-formatted README document, saving time and ensuring consistent documentation.

## Technologies Used

The project leverages the following technologies:

*   **Next.js:** A React framework for building server-rendered and statically generated web applications.
*   **TypeScript:** A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing, improving code maintainability and reducing errors.
*   **ESLint:** A JavaScript linter that enforces code style and helps identify potential issues.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly styling web applications.
